	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is the time taken by the algorithm to execute each set of instructions. It is always better to select the most efficient algorithm when a simple problem can solve with different methods.
	</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is usually referred to as the amount of memory consumed by the algorithm.
       O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size. </p>
